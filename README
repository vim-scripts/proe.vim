This is for Wildfire 2.  I doubt there are big changes in 3, but let me know.

I prefixed syntax items with "mk_" because Pro/E files are largely used for 'Mapkeys'.
However, some of the syntax items here apply to general Pro/E syntax.

There is no vocabulary built in.  I was unable to download a good list of commands.  This documentation for Wildfire 2 is in PDF form, and translating to text and HTML both fail miserably for me.

I'm confused as to why the tildes ~ and the 'mapkey(continued) ' markings were necessary to the syntax... thoughts, anyone?
